# 🤖 AI Chatbot with NLP

A simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python and NLTK. This chatbot answers basic math-related questions and includes a built-in calculator for performing arithmetic operations.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

chatbot/
├── chatbot.py        # Main Python script for the chatbot
├── README.md         # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt  # (Optional) Python dependencies

````

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Responds to basic math questions (e.g., addition, prime numbers, even/odd)
- ✅ Built-in calculator via command line
- ✅ Friendly conversational interface
- ✅ Developed using Python and NLTK

## 💬 Example Questions You Can Ask

- `What is addition?`
- `What is a prime number?`
- `What is an odd number?`
- `What is subtraction?`

Or type `calc` to enter calculator mode:

1. Addition  
2. Subtraction  
3. Multiplication  
4. Division  

## 💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parth-trivedi-12/AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP.git
cd AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
````

2. **Install required packages**

```bash
pip install nltk
```

3. **Run the chatbot**

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

> The script automatically downloads NLTK's `punkt` tokenizer if it's not already available.

## 🧪 Sample Interaction

```bash
Hi! I'm your AI Chatbot.
You can ask me math questions or type 'calc' to use the calculator.
Type 'quit' to exit.

> hi
Hello! Ask me any math question or type 'calc' if you want to do some calculations.

> calc
Welcome to the Calculator!
Choose operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
...
```

## 📦 Optional: Create `requirements.txt`

If needed, create a `requirements.txt`:

```
nltk
```

Then run:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Future Ideas

* Add a graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt
* Expand question database (algebra, geometry, etc.)
* Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech features
* Migrate to advanced NLP tools (spaCy, transformers)
